This project is a Xcode template for creating new modules and test files for VIPER architecture in swift.

Copy .xctemplate files to "/Users/<user_name>/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates"

Now you can find your template in Xcode under Templates section when u try to add a new file.

Notice that when you use templates, xcode create folder references instead of groups. So if u want to use groups;

Just create group from the folder and then delete the reference.

To do that point to the parent folder, right click and choose "Add files to..". 
Then choose your created folder, be sure if "Create groups" option is checked and press Add. 
After thet u can delete the folder reference..
